# TradeFlow Human / Developer System Handbook

**Status:** Living document  
**Version:** 3.5  
**Date:** 17 September 2026  
**Audience:** Platform owner, tenant owners, administrators, staff and future developers

## 1. Purpose and authority
This handbook records TradeFlow architecture, security boundaries, workflow rules, implementation decisions, faults, lessons and exact build position.

Authority order: **current GitHub code + current Supabase state + structured project memory/checkpoints + verified live behaviour**. A Git commit is implementation evidence, not proof of live behaviour.

## 2. Architecture baseline
TradeFlow is a generic multi-tenant Buy & Sell SaaS. `tenant_id` is the primary tenant boundary.

Tenant roles are exactly `owner`, `admin`, `staff`. Platform Owner is a separate platform-level boundary and is never a tenant role. GearCashOut is reference material only and must never be modified during TradeFlow work.

## 3. Security checkpoints
- Customer isolation/security: **34/34 passed**.
- Customer subscription tests: **Buying 17/17; Selling 17/17 passed**.
- Staff security lab: **19/19 passed**.
- Recorded RLS checkpoint: **60/60 public tables enabled**.
- Platform Owner foundation: 044–045.
- Platform-admin privileged paths: 046–048; final browser regression remains open.
- Buying hardening: 049–051.
- Valuation/Offer hardening: 052–055.
- Acquisition hardening: 056–057.
- Inventory hardening: 058.
- Finance permission/workflow hardening: 059–060.
- Selling/listing hardening: 061.
- Retail order hardening: 062.
- Fulfilment/returns hardening: current live migration.
- Category/inventory media foundation: tenant-scoped media links, private storage bucket and retention metadata/triggers.
- External payment boundary: provider/event idempotency plus deployed Stripe Checkout and webhook Edge Functions.

## 4. Production onboarding — OPEN
Development tenant insertion/test-lab paths are not the production SaaS onboarding model.

Required sequence: **Platform Owner / approved onboarding → tenant → initial owner → subscription → tenant owner/admin/staff management.** Never permit self-claimed Platform Owner access or create a `platform_owner` tenant role.

## 5. Subscription and permission architecture
Capabilities use plans, `plan_features`, `tenant_subscriptions`, `private.has_tenant_feature()` and `private.require_tenant_feature()`.

Relevant permissions include `buying.view/manage`, `valuation.view/manage`, `offers.view/manage`, `acquisitions.view/manage`, `inventory.view/manage`, `selling.view/manage`, `orders.view/manage`, `fulfilment.view/manage`, `returns.view/manage` and `finance.view/manage`. No `module.finance` feature is assumed or invented.

## 6. Customer-facing and subscriber build
Implemented UI paths include Website Builder, public storefront renderer, customer authentication/dashboard, Buying, Offers, Acquisitions, Inventory, Finance, Selling/Listings, Orders, Fulfilment and Returns.

Category/property management is independent of Buying. Subscribers can create categories for Buying, Selling or both and define category-specific properties/options. Inventory supports direct product creation, category assignment, dynamic property values and photographs. Selling carries inventory photographs into new listings.

These remain BLUE until authenticated browser journeys are persistently tested.

## 7. Buying → Valuation → Offer
049–051 harden dynamic options and Buying workflow. 052–055 harden valuation/offer RLS, same-item valuation binding and state entry. Published offers require an approved valuation for the same tenant and buying item.

## 8. Acquisition
056–057 harden acquisition access and status entry. Inventory creation from an acquisition item is an explicit operation and is not inferred from acquisition status.

## 9. Categories, product properties and inventory media
`categories`, `category_fields` and `category_field_options` are the database-authoritative model. `category-management.html` / `.js` exposes category creation plus property and option creation. `inventory_assets.dynamic_values` stores category-specific product values.

Media foundation:
- private Storage bucket: `tradeflow-media`;
- `media_assets` retention metadata;
- `inventory_asset_media` tenant-scoped inventory links;
- `listing_media` tenant-scoped listing links;
- inventory/listing sold-status triggers setting a **90-day post-sale retention expiry**.

Private images use authenticated Storage and signed URLs. Physical object deletion must use the Storage API. Automatic cleanup scheduling is not configured.

## 10. Category browser tenant-context and cache delivery repair — 17 September 2026
The Categories page remained at `Loading categories…` after the first tenant-aware repair. The page URL had no `tenant_id` because the subscriber navigation opened `category-management.html` directly, and the visible browser entry did not appear to execute the newly deployed fallback.

The controller had already been changed to resolve a single active test tenant from authenticated `tenant_memberships` when no query tenant exists. To avoid continuing to depend on a repeatedly cached page entry, a fresh `categories.html` entry point was created. It loads `category-management.js?v=6`, resolves the authenticated active test tenant, displays categories and populates the property selector. Subscriber navigation now points to `categories.html`.

Commits:
- fresh Categories entry: `8e4be72483ddd1e46f4a24d87df5782159b9216d`
- Subscriber navigation: `028c2bf18b5306ba140ca99e0c9220188afe4998`

This is a browser delivery/cache repair only. No subscription, RLS or database category data was changed.

## 11. Inventory
058 protects inventory status entry. The repaired Inventory runtime supports product creation, category-specific dynamic values, multiple photographs and workflow-controlled lifecycle changes.

Lifecycle: `received → inspection → testing → repair → ready_for_sale → listed → reserved → sold`, with supported return/write-off/archive branches.

## 12. Finance and payment
059 applies permission-bound access to payment/ledger tables. 060 extends `transition_workflow_entity()` to payment and ledger entities and adds status-entry guards. No automatic payment or ledger creation is inferred from acquisition status.

`record_retail_order_payment()` is the internal subscriber payment path. `customer_create_order_payment()` provides the customer-side idempotent pending-payment boundary.

External Stripe architecture is server-side: `create-stripe-checkout-session` requires a customer JWT; `stripe-payment-webhook` verifies `stripe-signature` and calls protected `process_external_payment_event()`. `payment_provider_events` provides provider/event idempotency. Stripe test configuration is complete, but persistent browser payment verification remains open.

## 13. Selling / Listings
061 hardens listings and related access. Selling creates listings from ready-for-sale inventory and uses workflow authority. New listings inherit inventory media.

## 14. Retail Orders
062 hardens retail order access/status entry. Subscriber Orders creates orders from published listings. Customer checkout creates a pending-payment order, reserves the listing and uses the Stripe boundary for payment.

## 15. Fulfilment
Fulfilment has subscription-aware access and controlled lifecycle progression: `awaiting → label → dispatched → delivered`, with returned branches. No carrier API or automatic fulfilment creation is assumed.

## 16. Returns
Legacy broad returns policies were removed and direct status edits are blocked. `customer_request_return()` validates customer ownership and eligible order states; customer visibility uses secure `customer_get_returns()`.

## 17. Customer dashboard browser repair — VERIFIED LIVE
Customer sign-in/controller timing and navigation interception faults were repaired. The controller `esc()` parse fault was corrected and cache-busted to `v11`. Customer Buying category loading was isolated from optional modules because Test Business A lacks `module.orders`; `customer-dashboard-nav.js` independently loads `customer_get_buying_categories()` after portal reveal. No subscription capability was changed.

## 18. Subscriber JavaScript loading repair — 17 September 2026
Categories, Inventory and Selling shared a malformed `esc()` quote mapping, causing JavaScript parse failure before Supabase requests. Category was repaired in place; clean repaired Inventory and Selling runtimes were created. Inventory signed-URL requests also explicitly send JSON content type.

## 19. Diagnostic and verification standard
Trace every domain as: **User action → page → front-end controller → Supabase call → RPC/query → table/view → trigger/function/RLS/grants → status transition → external integration → visible result → verification state.**

Verification states: **Proposed → Implemented → Tested → Verified Live**. Commit success is not live verification. Transactional rollback testing proves database behaviour, not a persistent browser journey.

## 20. Manual testing and change control
One browser test at a time: exact URL → exact account → exact action → expected result → screenshot/result → PASS/FAIL → next test.

After each material change record what/why, affected files/backend objects, decision, fault/lesson, test, live verification, stopping point and next action. Update this handbook, the Master Roadmap, the AI Operating Manual and structured project memory/checkpoint data where available.

## 21. Current stopping point — 17 September 2026
The shared subscriber JavaScript parse fault is repaired. The old Categories URL continued to deliver a stale/non-executing page, so a fresh `categories.html` entry point and Subscriber navigation route have now been deployed. Browser verification remains open.

**Next action:** open the fresh Categories entry from the Subscriber Dashboard, confirm Test Business A / `Drones`, then test Properties and create the first property. Continue one verified stage at a time through Inventory → Photograph → Ready for Sale → Listing → Customer Shop → Stripe Sandbox.
