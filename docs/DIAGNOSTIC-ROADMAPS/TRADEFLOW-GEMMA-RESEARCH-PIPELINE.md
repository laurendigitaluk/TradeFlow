# TradeFlow Gemma Research Pipeline — Diagnostic Roadmap

Updated: 7 November 2026

## Operating boundary
- LIVE project gxsrajtqzdjvmceqcpgv is the only authoritative research task and evidence-review queue.
- TEST project nnsshnfkjcflucjrftzi remains for software development, migrations and regression fixtures. Existing TEST data remains untouched.
- Gemma discovers candidate UK market evidence. Owner/ChatGPT verifies; no autonomous approval or master catalogue/evidence write is permitted.

## Dashboard entry points
- Platform Owner dashboard: platform-owner-dashboard.html.
- Category research team cards: platform-owner-dashboard.js → renderGemmaResearcherCards.
- Category source manager: loadGemmaSources / addGemmaResearchSource.
- Owner source RPCs: platform_owner_list_research_sources(text), platform_owner_add_research_source(text,text,text,text,text,text), platform_owner_set_research_source_category(uuid,text,boolean).
- How It Works / Examples editor: platform-public-pages-editor.js → node/render/save.
- Platform AI provider settings: platform-owner-dashboard.html / platform-owner-dashboard.js → platform_owner_get_ai_settings and platform_owner_update_ai_settings.

## Category and source model
- Canonical LIVE 3D category is 3d-printers-equipment / “3D Printers & Equipment”.
- Two existing telemetry agent keys (3d-printers, 3d-printers-equipment) are grouped into one UI team card. Both records and their history are preserved.
- Pokémon master category already exists as pokemon-trading-cards. It is displayed as a reserved category but has no source assignment or research agent linkage.
- Category sources live in platform_research_sources.category_slugs. * means universal; current Amazon UK and eBay UK remain universal.
- Owner source RPCs validate active platform membership and active category. Universal sources are read-only from category-specific toggles.
- Research worker continues to filter enabled sources by category slug and manufacturer; no matching approved sources means fail closed.

## How It Works editor
- Nested objects and arrays in public-page draft JSON are rendered as collapsed details sections, expanded individually by the owner.
- Save/publish RPCs and existing draft/published workflow remain unchanged.

## AI provider boundary
- Subscribers cannot supply their own AI provider.
- Owner dashboard no longer exposes a subscriber-provider option. Its save call always sends p_subscriber_provider_enabled=false.
- LIVE update RPC already rejects subscriber-supplied providers and persists false.

## Verification and known limitations
- LIVE category/source table and telemetry inspected before change.
- LIVE owner source RPC migration applied; verify RPC signatures and category source data after deployment.
- The browser owner dashboard must be refreshed after the Cloudflare static asset deployment.
- Pokémon has no category-specific sources and is not to be dispatched.
- LIVE laptops agent status exists but its master category was previously missing; don't attach laptop sources until master category reconciliation.
- Full browser acceptance for adding/toggling a source, collapsible editor interactions and public publish workflow remains required.


## 7 November 2026 — LIVE batch research controls and How It Works editor

- Dashboard entry: `platform-owner-dashboard.html` → Gemma Control Centre → Build a category research batch.
- Front-end: `platform-owner-dashboard.js` functions `loadGemmaBatchCategories`, `loadGemmaBatchBranches`, `loadGemmaBatchProducts`, `submitGemmaBatch`; presentation styles in `platform-owner-dashboard.css`.
- LIVE data: `catalogue_master_categories`, `catalogue_master_branches`, `catalogue_master_products`, `catalogue_master_manufacturers`, `shared_market_evidence`.
- LIVE RPCs: `platform_owner_list_gemma_research_categories()` returns active categories and branches; `platform_owner_list_gemma_research_products(text,text,text,integer)` returns category/branch products and active UK new/used evidence counts. Both validate active `platform_memberships`; anon execute is revoked.
- Batch enqueue uses existing `platform_owner_enqueue_ai_agent_task` and a payload with multiple `tasks`. The existing `task-worker.mjs` iterates the task array and calls `runTask` for each product.
- Coverage filters: all, missing new, missing used, missing both, missing either, has new, has used. Research type: `uk_new`, `uk_used`, `uk_both`. Batch size: 10, 20, 50, 100 or all selected (selection is limited to products currently displayed, up to 500).
- How It Works: public file `how-it-works.html` is already the accordion/text-only page. Owner editor `platform-public-pages-editor.js` suppresses legacy `screenshots` and `visual_layout` fields for `how-it-works`; `platform-public-pages-visual-editor.js` now exports a separate Examples editor loader and no longer overwrites `window.loadPublicPages`.
- Platform AI provider settings panel and nav entry removed from `platform-owner-dashboard.html`; its obsolete JS load/save handlers are no longer called. Subscriber-provided AI remains disabled by the existing server-side setting/RPC boundary.
- LIVE database function grants verified: anon=false, authenticated=true with active-owner validation in function body. Cloudflare/browser acceptance and an end-to-end Research PC batch remain outstanding.


## Batch selection safeguards
- The batch selector omits `pokemon-trading-cards` until its source/agent linkage is deliberately enabled. The master category remains intact.
- Batch enqueue submits the first N selected products according to the chosen batch size and retains the remaining selections for subsequent submissions.
- The 3D printer coverage query was checked against LIVE: 201 active products; 1 missing UK new evidence; 190 missing UK used evidence; 0 missing both; 191 missing either. These are a point-in-time count, not a permanent status.

## AI Agent Common Room — 7 November 2026

- Owner view: `platform-owner-dashboard.html` → `ai-agent-common-room`.
- Owner runtime: `loadAiAgentCommonRoom()` and `postAiAgentCommonRoom()` in `platform-owner-dashboard.js`.
- LIVE storage: `public.platform_ai_agent_messages`.
- Owner RPCs: `platform_owner_list_ai_agent_messages(...)`, `platform_owner_post_ai_agent_message(...)`; both enforce active `platform_memberships`.
- Agent RPCs: `platform_ai_agent_list_messages(...)`, `platform_ai_agent_post_message(...)`; only service_role can execute.
- Worker integration: `tools/tradeflow-gemma-agent/src/task-worker.mjs` → `roomRpc`, `roomRead`, `roomPost`. It posts startup/task status, completion/failure and handover, and reads shared notes/instructions.
- Owner-only instruction posts are separated from agent post types. Messages are not research jobs or approved evidence.
- Branch `feature/ai-agent-common-room-20261107`; migration, worker and owner UI not yet merged/applied/deployed. PC restart and round-trip acceptance are required.
- Never expose service-role credentials in browser/subscriber UI/GitHub. Preserve the PC `.env` and configured env-file path.

## Common Room prompt integration — 7 November 2026
The Research PC worker entry is tools/tradeflow-gemma-agent/src/task-worker.mjs. At task start it reads up to 100 relevant LIVE Common Room messages, filters instruction/handover/finding/question/learning_note types, maps at most ten into task.common_room_context, and passes them to runTask. The extraction function in tools/tradeflow-gemma-agent/src/agent.mjs includes the bounded notes in the Ollama prompt.

The prompt explicitly treats these notes as untrusted operational guidance. They cannot override the authoritative task definition, exact manufacturer/model/package identity, research_type, category source allow-list, UK/GBP constraints, direct product-page requirements, evidence validator, privacy or ChatGPT/owner review gate. If the Common Room read fails, the worker logs the error and proceeds without notes; it does not fail or block the research task.

The worker posts startup, task-start, handover, completion and failure messages to the LIVE Common Room. These are status/reporting messages only and do not approve candidates or import catalogue/evidence.

The Research PC has not yet been updated/restarted with this code. Verify the controlled owner-instruction → worker read → Gemma extraction prompt → handover → owner-visible feed round-trip before describing this as operational. Preserve the separate local .env and TRADEFLOW_GEMMA_ENV_FILE path.

 
## Common Room delivery routing correction — 7 November 2026
The worker reads across all threads (p_thread_key = null), not just General. It supplies its category slug so the RPC returns global messages with category_slug null plus messages for the matching category. Recipient matching supports null/all/*, the exact p_agent_key, p_worker_id, gemma-task-worker and research-agents. Messages addressed only to chatgpt-supervisor or engineering-agents are not delivered to the Gemma worker.

The final LIVE platform_ai_agent_list_messages and platform_ai_agent_post_message functions use an empty search_path, validate auth.jwt()->>'role' = 'service_role', revoke execution from public/anon/authenticated and grant only service_role. The owner list/post RPCs also use an empty search_path, require an active platform_memberships row and are executable only by authenticated owners. The additive routing/security migrations were applied and verified. No test messages remain. This is source/database verification only; the Research PC still needs code update/restart and an end-to-end owner instruction → worker read → handover → owner feed test.

 
## Post-merge worker bootstrap fix and PC updater — 7 November 2026
- PR #267 merged to production as 45049f5c4a1b131d95b701b2603fe0a351c392bd.
- A production-source check found task-worker.mjs imported ./task-groups.mjs, but that module was absent from the production tree. The worker would fail at module resolution before it could poll the queue.
- Fixed the worker to import src/task-groups.mjs and added normaliseProductResearchTasks(), which filters malformed queue entries and deduplicates identical product/category/branch/agent/package/research-type tasks while retaining distinct products and research types.
- Added src/task-groups.test.mjs using Node's built-in test runner. Four local tests passed for invalid inputs, malformed rows, duplicate removal and distinct task preservation.
- Added tools/tradeflow-gemma-agent/Update-TradeFlow-Gemma.ps1 and README.md. The updater downloads only the reviewed source/test files, checks Node 18+, validates approved TEST/LIVE URLs in the supplied private .env, runs node --check and node --test before installation, backs up old source files, and replaces only src files.
- The updater never prints, copies, backs up or overwrites the private .env. It accepts the existing path and sets TRADEFLOW_GEMMA_ENV_FILE before starting the worker. For first install it supports a new dedicated TradeFlow folder, separate from the retired GearCashOut source.
- The updater has not been run on the Research PC. Local path, Ollama availability, worker start and Common Room round-trip remain unverified.

 
## Queue task validation refinement — 7 November 2026
The task normaliser now rejects incomplete payload rows before calling runTask. It requires category_slug, manufacturer, model, package_key, package_name, search_query and a research_type of uk_new, uk_used or uk_both. The Owner Dashboard's production task builder supplies these fields. Tests cover incomplete payload rejection as well as valid rows, malformed rows, duplicate removal and preservation of distinct task definitions. Four tests pass.


## Research Again retry path — 7 November 2026

### User action and front-end
- Entry: Owner Dashboard → Gemma Control Centre → Research queue → **Research again**.
- Front end: `platform-owner-dashboard.js` → `loadGemmaQueue()` stores the loaded LIVE candidate rows in `window.gemmaQueueItems`; `reviewGemmaCandidate(id, 'needs_research')` resolves the exact candidate and builds one product-level task.
- Task fields: `category_slug`, optional `branch_slug`, `agent_key`, `manufacturer`, `model`, `package_key`, `package_name`, `research_type: uk_both`, `search_query`.

### Dispatch and data flow
`Research again` → authenticated `platform_owner_enqueue_ai_agent_task(p_task_key, p_payload, p_priority)` → `platform_ai_agent_tasks` (LIVE) → `platform_ai_agent_claim_task(p_worker_id, p_lease_seconds)` → Research PC `task-worker.mjs` → `normaliseProductResearchTasks()` → `runTask()` → `platform_catalogue_research_queue` (LIVE) → owner/ChatGPT review.

The UI must enqueue first. Only after enqueue succeeds does it call `platform_owner_review_catalogue_research_item(p_id, 'needs_research', p_notes)`. If enqueue fails, the candidate status is left unchanged. The new task key is unique per retry; the existing candidate and prior evidence are retained. No direct browser writes to task tables and no service-role key in the dashboard.

### Failure found and repair
- LIVE candidate `b94e2225-c07b-4001-8dfa-cd045bf962fd` (Creality K1) was changed to `needs_research` at 16:38:30 UTC.
- The old production handler called only `platform_owner_review_catalogue_research_item`; the task queue had no new task row. The brief button flash was therefore consistent with the handler's actual behaviour.
- The correction was merged to `production` in PR #268 as `a76cf1e3d0ea5e9c068f05a9242cab98d5839f3e`. It also retains the owner review gate and requests `uk_both` so both new and used evidence can be sought.
- Production worker remains unchanged; it already polls LIVE and claims tasks. One controlled task was claimed/completed and a handover/completion message was confirmed in `platform_ai_agent_messages`.
- Cloudflare LIVE deployment and browser acceptance of the corrected button remain pending. Do not claim the fix is live until the dashboard asset is deployed and a new task appears after clicking Research again.


## Category source expansion — 7 November 2026
LIVE source registry change: seven sources added exclusively to `3d-printers-equipment`: Gumtree UK (marketplace, used_uk), Uni3Dverse (used_dealer, used_uk), 3DGBIRE (used_dealer, used_uk), SecondHand.org.uk (marketplace, used_uk), 123-3D UK (retailer, new_uk), iDig3DPrinting UK (retailer, new_uk), 3DFLO UK (retailer, new_uk). Existing universal Amazon UK and eBay UK remain shared sources. Verified site evidence supports Gumtree's live used printer ads, SecondHand's 3D printer listings, Uni3Dverse's dedicated used/refurbished page, 3DGBIRE's reconditioned listings, and the three new retailer catalogues. Current worker source probing selects at most 12 approved sources, round-robins new/used/official buckets, and probes at most three URL patterns per source; social platforms are not yet a proven direct-evidence path. Before broad rollout, test each source's actual search route, exact-model discovery, product-page fetch, and extraction. Correct Creality's fixed K1 detail-page search template so it does not repeatedly revisit one product. Manufacturer matching is already constrained by `isRelevantApprovedSource()`; keep Canon camera tasks mapped to Canon sources and DJI drone tasks mapped to DJI sources.

Follow-up LIVE source additions, 7 November 2026: added Bambu Lab UK Official Store (`bambu-lab-uk.myshopify.com`) and Anycubic UK Official Store (`uk.anycubic.com`) as `manufacturer`/`official`, each assigned only to `3d-printers-equipment`. The category now resolves to 14 enabled UK sources when the two existing universal sources are included: 3 manufacturer official sources, 5 specialist new retailers, 2 used/refurbished dealers, 3 used marketplaces (including eBay), and 1 universal Amazon retailer. Important implementation constraint discovered in production worker: `probeApprovedResearchSources()` currently selects at most 12 sources and tries at most three URL patterns per source. The 3D-printer category now has 14 sources, so the worker cap can silently prevent some designated sites from being probed. Increase/replace this cap with a fair, observable source sweep before claiming all 14 are searched. Also correct Creality's K1-only `search_url_template`. Social sources (e.g. Facebook Marketplace) remain a separate discovery capability; do not treat login-gated/social post snippets as validated price evidence.

## First-agent rollout: 3D Printers & Equipment website playbooks and Common Room inbox — 7 November 2026
- A first category-specific website playbook has been added at `tools/tradeflow-gemma-agent/src/source-playbooks.mjs`, exclusively for `3d-printers-equipment`. It defines manufacturer, new-retailer, used/refurbished dealer and marketplace routes/navigation for Creality, Bambu Lab, Anycubic, Uni3Dverse, 3DGBIRE, 3D Prima, 123-3D, iDig3DPrinting, 3DFLO, 3DJake, Gumtree, SecondHand.org.uk, eBay UK and Amazon UK.
- Rule: search/category/collection pages are discovery only. Gemma must extract exact-model links, open individual product/listing pages, and validate model/package, UK GBP price, condition and availability before returning evidence. Accessories, consumables, upgrades, mismatched variants, sold/completed listings and unverified social snippets are not evidence.
- `probeApprovedResearchSources()` now uses website-specific routes, ignores a stale configured direct `/products/...` URL as a search route, and no longer caps the balanced category source sweep at 12. The 3D-printer source count can exceed 12; all category-approved sources are now included in the balanced new/used/official rotation. Up to five site-specific routes are attempted per source. Source attempts and route failures are reported through progress telemetry.
- The first Common Room inbox/reply behaviour is scoped only to `3d-printers-equipment`. The Research PC worker checks the LIVE Common Room at startup, before this agent's tasks, and while idle between queue polls. It replies to the owner's first-visit welcome message, acknowledges unanswered owner instructions, and drafts concise answers to unanswered questions with local Ollama. Replies are linked by `parent_message_id`, and existing replies are checked to avoid duplication. The existing worker still passes relevant owner/agent instructions into the extraction context; hard-coded evidence rules and owner approval gates remain authoritative.
- This does not yet enable automatic Common Room replies for other categories. Roll out one agent at a time after acceptance testing the 3D-printer agent.
- Updater now downloads/tests `source-playbooks.mjs` and `source-playbooks.test.mjs` alongside the existing worker files. No private `.env`, legacy GearCashOut config, Supabase schema, TEST tenant data, LIVE catalogue/evidence approval, Stripe or Cloudflare configuration was changed by this code branch.
- Deployment remains pending: merge the reviewed branch, run the updater on the Research PC using the existing TradeFlow install and exact existing TradeFlow `.env` path, stop the old worker cleanly, restart, then verify the 3D Printer Gemma greeting is posted as a threaded reply to the owner's Welcome message. Do not claim the behaviour is live until that round-trip is visible in AI Common Room.
- Known follow-up after acceptance: verify each website route against live pages, record per-site success/failure, improve pagination/load-more handling where needed, then enable the next category agent. Social-platform discovery remains a separate capability and must not be represented as implemented by this first rollout.
