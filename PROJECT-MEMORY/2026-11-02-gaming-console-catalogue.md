Date: 2 November 2026
Repository: laurendigitaluk/TradeFlow

This is the aggregate continuity record for the TradeFlow gaming hardware catalogue. The detailed first batch checkpoint is CHECKPOINTS/2026-11-02-gaming-console-catalogue-batch-01.md.

## Current verified position
- Category: Gaming Consoles & Accessories.
- TEST and LIVE both contain 62 master products, 54 active customer-visible products and 125 active evidence rows (17 UK new / 108 UK used).
- Both environments have 0 visible active products without evidence, 0 evidence integrity failures and 0 products with null branch assignments.
- Existing PlayStation and Xbox catalogue records were retained. Ten Sony products previously lacking a branch were mapped to the existing PlayStation branches.
- Nintendo is now a master manufacturer with four branches: Nintendo Consoles, Nintendo Handheld Consoles, Nintendo Controllers and Nintendo Accessories.
- Five Nintendo products and seven active UK evidence rows were added independently in each environment. Product/evidence UUIDs differ between TEST and LIVE.

## Current Nintendo coverage
- Switch 2 256GB: UK new £389.99 Smyths Toys UK (current listing; RRP £419.99) and UK used £309 median across 153 eBay UK sales to 25 Oct 2026.
- Switch OLED 64GB: UK used £145 eBay completed sale.
- Switch V2 32GB: UK used £62.99 eBay completed sale.
- Switch Lite 32GB: UK used £72 eBay completed sale.
- Switch 2 Pro Controller: UK new £74.99 Nintendo Store UK and UK used £47.08 eBay completed sale.

Older Switch models have no new-price evidence in this batch. Keep them active for used valuation and do not infer new prices or lifecycle state.

## Data rules
- New and used evidence remain distinct: evidence_type uk_new / uk_used.
- Currency is GBP only.
- Use availability listed for active retailer listings and sold for completed-sale observations.
- Exact product variant, URL, source_record_key, price and date must match.
- Buyer Protection amounts and accepted-offer ambiguity must be noted; never imply the buyer-facing total is seller proceeds.
- Trade-in/buyback quotes, marketplace asking prices and overseas sales are not equivalent to completed UK used sales.
- Research evidence is reference material only and does not automatically alter buying/valuation prices.

## Environment and architecture notes
- TEST Supabase: nnsshnfkjcflucjrftzi.
- LIVE Supabase: gxsrajtqzdjvmceqcpgv.
- GitHub TEST branch: main.
- GitHub LIVE branch: production.
- No project-memory/checkpoint table was found in non-system schemas of LIVE; do not invent a structured Supabase memory layer. Repository project-memory and checkpoint files are the continuity record for this workstream.

## Open work
1. Expand Nintendo Switch 2 and original Switch accessories with exact UK new and used evidence.
2. Add older Nintendo hardware where supported: 3DS/2DS, Wii, GameCube and relevant controllers.
3. Complete Xbox controllers, headsets, batteries, storage expansion and accessories.
4. Complete PlayStation controllers, VR, headsets, charging docks, cameras and other accessories.
5. Continue reconciling product and evidence coverage across TEST and LIVE without copying environment-specific IDs or business data.
