# TradeFlow Human / Developer System Handbook

**Status:** Living document  
**Version:** 4.0  
**Date:** 18 September 2026  
**Audience:** Platform owner, tenant owners, administrators, staff and future developers

## 1. Purpose and authority
This handbook records TradeFlow architecture, security boundaries, workflow rules, implementation decisions, faults, lessons, verification state and exact build position.

Authority order: **current GitHub code + current Supabase state + structured project memory/checkpoints + verified live behaviour**. A Git commit is implementation evidence, not proof of live behaviour.

## 2. Architecture baseline
TradeFlow is a generic multi-tenant Buy & Sell SaaS. `tenant_id` is the primary tenant boundary.

Tenant roles are exactly `owner`, `admin`, `staff`. Platform Owner is a separate platform-level boundary and is never a tenant role. GearCashOut is reference material only and must never be modified during TradeFlow work.

## 3. Security checkpoints
- Customer isolation/security: **34/34 passed**.
- Customer subscription tests: **Buying 17/17; Selling 17/17 passed**.
- Staff security lab: **19/19 passed**.
- Recorded RLS checkpoint: **60/60 public tables enabled**.
- Platform Owner foundation: 044–045.
- Platform-admin privileged paths: 046–048; final browser regression remains open.
- Buying hardening: 049–051.
- Valuation/Offer hardening: 052–055.
- Acquisition hardening: 056–057.
- Inventory hardening: 058.
- Finance permission/workflow hardening: 059–060.
- Selling/listing hardening: 061.
- Retail order hardening: 062.
- Fulfilment/returns hardening: current live migration.
- Category/inventory media foundation: tenant-scoped media links, private storage bucket and retention metadata/triggers.
- External payment boundary: provider/event idempotency plus deployed Stripe Checkout and webhook Edge Functions.

## 4. Production onboarding — OPEN
Development tenant insertion/test-lab paths are not the production SaaS onboarding model.

Required sequence: **Platform Owner / approved onboarding → tenant → initial owner → subscription → tenant owner/admin/staff management.** Never permit self-claimed Platform Owner access or create a `platform_owner` tenant role.

## 5. Subscription and permission architecture
Capabilities use plans, `plan_features`, `tenant_subscriptions`, `private.has_tenant_feature()` and `private.require_tenant_feature()`.

Relevant permissions include `buying.view/manage`, `valuation.view/manage`, `offers.view/manage`, `acquisitions.view/manage`, `inventory.view/manage`, `selling.view/manage`, `orders.view/manage`, `fulfilment.view/manage`, `returns.view/manage` and `finance.view/manage`. No `module.finance` feature is assumed or invented.

## 6. Customer-facing and subscriber build
Implemented UI paths include Website Builder, public storefront renderer, customer authentication/dashboard, Buying, Offers, Acquisitions, Inventory, Finance, Selling/Listings, Orders, Fulfilment and Returns.

Category/property management is independent of Buying. Subscribers can create categories for Buying, Selling or both and define category-specific properties/options. Inventory supports direct product creation, category assignment, dynamic property values and photographs. Selling carries inventory photographs into new listings.

These remain BLUE until authenticated browser journeys are persistently tested.

## 7. Buying → Valuation → Offer
049–051 harden dynamic options and Buying workflow. 052–055 harden valuation/offer RLS, same-item valuation binding and state entry. Published offers require an approved valuation for the same tenant and buying item.

## 8. Acquisition
056–057 harden acquisition access and status entry. Inventory creation from an acquisition item is an explicit operation and is not inferred from acquisition status.

## 9. Categories, product properties and inventory media
`categories`, `category_fields` and `category_field_options` are the database-authoritative model. `category-management.html` / `.js` exposes category creation plus property and option creation. `inventory_assets.dynamic_values` stores category-specific product values.

Media foundation:
- private Storage bucket: `tradeflow-media`;
- `media_assets` retention metadata;
- `inventory_asset_media` tenant-scoped inventory links;
- `listing_media` tenant-scoped listing links;
- inventory/listing sold-status triggers setting a **90-day post-sale retention expiry**.

Private images use authenticated Storage and signed URLs. Physical object deletion must use the Storage API. Automatic cleanup scheduling is not configured.

## 10. Subscriber category tenant-context and REST repairs — 17 September 2026
The category database/RLS path was verified independently: Test Business A contains active Buying/Selling `Drones`, and the authenticated owner query returns it. Front-end repairs addressed missing tenant context, unnecessary GET `Content-Type`, missing request timeout and late runtime diagnostics.

A shared `subscriber-tenant-context.js` preloader establishes test-lab tenant context before subscriber controllers. GET/HEAD requests are normalised so they do not carry unnecessary JSON `Content-Type`.

## 11. Dedicated subscriber authentication — 17 September 2026
The screenshot showing `Sign in through the TradeFlow test environment before opening Categories.` identified the deeper issue: the subscriber workspace was trying to use the **customer test-lab session/storage keys**. Platform Owner authentication is deliberately separate too, so opening Platform Administration does not authenticate a subscriber workspace.

A dedicated `subscriber-auth.js` now provides test-environment subscriber authentication. It uses separate storage keys (`tradeflow_subscriber_publishable_key` and `tradeflow_subscriber_session`), signs in by email/password, verifies an active membership in the selected Test Business A/B tenant, and sets the subscriber tenant context. Passwords are not stored.

`subscriber-auth-bridge.js` is a compatibility layer for the existing Category, Inventory and Selling controllers. On those subscriber pages only, reads of the legacy test-lab key names resolve to the dedicated subscriber session. This prevents the Customer Test Lab session from being overwritten. After a new subscriber login, the bridge reloads the page so legacy controllers start with the authenticated subscriber context.

`subscriber-auth-controls.js` binds the existing page sign-out control to the dedicated subscriber session.

Current pages wired to dedicated subscriber authentication:
- `categories.html`
- `inventory-dashboard.html`
- `selling-dashboard.html`

This is test-environment infrastructure. It is not the final production onboarding/authentication model.

## 12. Inventory
058 protects inventory status entry. The repaired Inventory runtime supports product creation, category-specific dynamic values, multiple photographs and workflow-controlled lifecycle changes.

Lifecycle: `received → inspection → testing → repair → ready_for_sale → listed → reserved → sold`, with supported return/write-off/archive branches.

## 13. Finance and payment
059 applies permission-bound access to payment/ledger tables. 060 extends `transition_workflow_entity()` to payment and ledger entities and adds status-entry guards. No automatic payment or ledger creation is inferred from acquisition status.

`record_retail_order_payment()` is the internal subscriber payment path. `customer_create_order_payment()` provides the customer-side idempotent pending-payment boundary.

External Stripe architecture is server-side: `create-stripe-checkout-session` requires a customer JWT; `stripe-payment-webhook` verifies `stripe-signature` and calls protected `process_external_payment_event()`. `payment_provider_events` provides provider/event idempotency. Stripe test configuration is complete, but persistent browser payment verification remains open.

## 14. Selling / Listings
061 hardens listings and related access. Selling creates listings from ready-for-sale inventory and uses workflow authority. New listings inherit inventory media.

## 15. Retail Orders
062 hardens retail order access/status entry. Subscriber Orders creates orders from published listings. Customer checkout creates a pending-payment order, reserves the listing and uses the Stripe boundary for payment.

## 16. Fulfilment
Fulfilment has subscription-aware access and controlled lifecycle progression: `awaiting → label → dispatched → delivered`, with returned branches. No carrier API or automatic fulfilment creation is assumed.

## 17. Returns
Legacy broad returns policies were removed and direct status edits are blocked. `customer_request_return()` validates customer ownership and eligible order states; customer visibility uses secure `customer_get_returns()`.

## 18. Customer dashboard browser repair — VERIFIED LIVE
Customer sign-in/controller timing and navigation interception faults were repaired. The controller `esc()` parse fault was corrected and cache-busted to `v11`. Customer Buying category loading was isolated from optional modules because Test Business A lacks `module.orders`; `customer-dashboard-nav.js` independently loads `customer_get_buying_categories()` after portal reveal. No subscription capability was changed.

## 19. Subscriber JavaScript loading repair — 17 September 2026
Categories, Inventory and Selling shared a malformed `esc()` quote mapping, causing JavaScript parse failure before Supabase requests. Category was repaired in place; clean repaired Inventory and Selling runtimes were created. Inventory signed-URL requests also explicitly send JSON content type.

## 20. Diagnostic and verification standard
Trace every domain as: **User action → page → front-end controller → Supabase call → RPC/query → table/view → trigger/function/RLS/grants → status transition → external integration → visible result → verification state.**

Verification states: **Proposed → Implemented → Tested → Verified Live**. Commit success is not live verification. Transactional rollback testing proves database behaviour, not a persistent browser journey.

## 21. Manual testing and change control
One browser test at a time: exact URL → exact account → exact action → expected result → screenshot/result → PASS/FAIL → next test.

After each material change record what/why, affected files/backend objects, decision, fault/lesson, test, live verification, stopping point and next action. Update this handbook, the Master Roadmap, the AI Operating Manual and structured project memory/checkpoint data where available.

## 22. Current stopping point — 17 September 2026
The category database/RLS path is verified. The browser failure was traced to subscriber pages using customer test-lab session storage instead of a subscriber session. Dedicated subscriber authentication plus a compatibility bridge is now deployed to Categories, Inventory and Selling. **Live browser verification of the new sign-in flow is open.**

**Next action:** hard refresh/open Categories. A Subscriber sign-in dialog should appear if no dedicated subscriber session exists. Sign in using an active Test Business A Owner/Admin/Staff account, select Test Business A, and verify `Drones` appears. Then use the same session to verify Inventory and Selling category selectors. Do not alter subscriptions, category data or RLS to work around this.


## Test Business C — Buy & Sell end-to-end test tenant — 18 September 2026

- Created dedicated test tenant Test Business C (50641519-2aa5-4093-95e5-7e92bea733a6) on the live TradeFlow test environment.
- Assigned the existing Test Business A Admin test identity as an Admin member; no Owner account is required for routine workflow testing.
- Assigned the buy_sell plan in trialing state so Inventory/Selling capability checks can be exercised without weakening RLS or changing Test Business A's Buying-only subscription.
- Seeded a Drones category with model_number (text) and condition (select) plus New/Excellent/Good/Fair/Poor options for end-to-end product testing.
- Added Test Business C to the subscriber authentication and tenant-context allowlists and cache-busted Categories, Inventory and Selling runtimes.
- Test Business A remains the Buying subscription test tenant; Test Business B remains the Selling subscription test tenant. This separation preserves subscription-boundary tests.


### Subscriber tenant switching repair — 18 September 2026

The Inventory RLS error was traced to the active browser workspace remaining on Test Business A, whose Buying-only subscription correctly rejects inventory_assets INSERT. Test Business C was verified separately: the Admin test identity is an active member, inventory.manage is true, and the Buy & Sell plan exposes module.inventory. The subscriber authentication layer previously had no visible tenant switch after an authenticated session was established, making the browser repeatedly remain on the stale tenant context. A tenant switcher has now been added to the subscriber top bar and cache-busted. It lists only tenants returned by the authenticated subscriber membership RPC and reloads the workspace with the selected tenant. No RLS policy was weakened.


## Subscriber tenant-context consolidation — 18 September 2026

- Deep inspection found multiple overlapping tenant/session layers: dedicated subscriber auth, a legacy compatibility bridge, and a test-lab tenant-context script. This could leave a subscriber workspace authenticated as one tenant while controllers read another tenant context.
- The subscriber authentication layer is now the single source of truth for the active tenant. The legacy subscriber-auth bridge was removed from Inventory and Selling page loads.
- subscriber-tenant-context.js no longer reads Customer/Test-Lab session storage or hard-coded user-to-tenant mappings; it waits for the dedicated subscriber auth promise and synchronises the URL tenant_id from that authenticated tenant.
- Categories controller now recognises Test Business C as well as A and B.
- Live verification: Test Business C has active Drones category; the Admin test user has inventory.view and inventory.manage; the Buy & Sell subscription has module.inventory enabled. Inventory RLS therefore remains unchanged.


## Subscription catalogue simplification — 18 September 2026

TradeFlow now has exactly two active customer-facing plans: **Basic** and **Enhanced**. Basic is the complete operational Buy & Sell core. Enhanced includes Basic plus every currently defined add-on capability (staff, staff messaging, audit, analytics, integrations and market intelligence). Legacy five-tier plan records remain inactive for historical traceability. The subscription capability layer remains unchanged as the enforcement boundary; code must continue to call the existing feature checks rather than hard-code plan names.


### Customer storefront and fulfilment checkpoint — 18 September 2026

The public website now includes a real customer-facing Shop section. It loads published subscriber site content and published listings through the controlled `public.get_published_store_listings(uuid)` SECURITY DEFINER function. The function is executable by `anon` and `authenticated` and exposes only storefront fields required for display. It requires a published website revision and filters listings to published status, active selling-enabled categories and active sales channels.

The public storefront remains separate from subscriber operational tables and does not expose customer, order, payment or internal workflow data. The existing paid Test Business C order has reserved the DJI test listing, so that item is intentionally not available in the public Shop.

The Fulfilment workspace has also been moved from the older test-lab session/key to the dedicated subscriber authentication layer. Test Business C has the fulfilment capability enabled and the current Admin test identity has `fulfilment.manage`. The next browser test is to create a fulfilment for `ORD-20260918-DB2A42EF` and then advance it one controlled transition at a time.

The current implementation is **Implemented Live** at the code/database boundary. Public storefront rendering, anonymous listing retrieval and fulfilment browser journeys remain **open for live browser verification**.


### Corrected TradeFlow product hierarchy — 18 September 2026

The top-level TradeFlow customer journey is the SaaS product journey, not a subscriber's public storefront. The intended hierarchy is:

**TradeFlow website → plan selection/subscriber signup → subscriber business account → Buy & Sell workspace → subscriber Website Builder → subscriber's separate customer-facing website.**

`index.html` is now the TradeFlow SaaS homepage. The former Customer Test Lab has been preserved at `test-lab.html` and is no longer the root product entry point. The tenant public renderer (`public-site.html`) remains a downstream customer-facing website for an individual subscriber and must not be treated as the TradeFlow SaaS homepage.

The SaaS homepage presents the two active plans, Basic and Enhanced, and routes into `subscriber-signup.html`. Subscriber onboarding uses Supabase Auth followed by the authenticated `subscriber_create_business()` RPC. That RPC creates the tenant, owner membership and trialing subscription for the selected active plan. Anonymous execution is explicitly revoked.

The live subscription records currently do not contain Stripe provider price IDs for the SaaS plans. Therefore recurring paid SaaS billing is not yet marked complete. The next billing build must add the production Stripe subscription boundary rather than pretending the existing retail checkout is the SaaS subscription checkout.

Subscriber authentication is now membership-driven: it obtains active tenant memberships from `subscriber_get_my_memberships()` rather than relying on a hard-coded list of Test Business A/B/C. This is necessary for newly onboarded subscribers and preserves the tenant boundary.
