# TradeFlow Human / Developer System Handbook

**Status:** Living document  
**Version:** 3.9  
**Date:** 17 September 2026  
**Audience:** Platform owner, tenant owners, administrators, staff and future developers

## 1. Purpose and authority
This handbook records TradeFlow architecture, security boundaries, workflow rules, implementation decisions, faults, lessons, verification state and exact build position.

Authority order: **current GitHub code + current Supabase state + structured project memory/checkpoints + verified live behaviour**. A Git commit is implementation evidence, not proof of live behaviour.

## 2. Architecture baseline
TradeFlow is a generic multi-tenant Buy & Sell SaaS. `tenant_id` is the primary tenant boundary.

Tenant roles are exactly `owner`, `admin`, `staff`. Platform Owner is a separate platform-level boundary and is never a tenant role. GearCashOut is reference material only and must never be modified during TradeFlow work.

## 3. Security checkpoints
- Customer isolation/security: **34/34 passed**.
- Customer subscription tests: **Buying 17/17; Selling 17/17 passed**.
- Staff security lab: **19/19 passed**.
- Recorded RLS checkpoint: **60/60 public tables enabled**.
- Platform Owner foundation: 044–045.
- Platform-admin privileged paths: 046–048; final browser regression remains open.
- Buying hardening: 049–051.
- Valuation/Offer hardening: 052–055.
- Acquisition hardening: 056–057.
- Inventory hardening: 058.
- Finance permission/workflow hardening: 059–060.
- Selling/listing hardening: 061.
- Retail order hardening: 062.
- Fulfilment/returns hardening: current live migration.
- Category/inventory media foundation: tenant-scoped media links, private storage bucket and retention metadata/triggers.
- External payment boundary: provider/event idempotency plus deployed Stripe Checkout and webhook Edge Functions.

## 4. Production onboarding — OPEN
Development tenant insertion/test-lab paths are not the production SaaS onboarding model.

Required sequence: **Platform Owner / approved onboarding → tenant → initial owner → subscription → tenant owner/admin/staff management.** Never permit self-claimed Platform Owner access or create a `platform_owner` tenant role.

## 5. Subscription and permission architecture
Capabilities use plans, `plan_features`, `tenant_subscriptions`, `private.has_tenant_feature()` and `private.require_tenant_feature()`.

Relevant permissions include `buying.view/manage`, `valuation.view/manage`, `offers.view/manage`, `acquisitions.view/manage`, `inventory.view/manage`, `selling.view/manage`, `orders.view/manage`, `fulfilment.view/manage`, `returns.view/manage` and `finance.view/manage`. No `module.finance` feature is assumed or invented.

## 6. Customer-facing and subscriber build
Implemented UI paths include Website Builder, public storefront renderer, customer authentication/dashboard, Buying, Offers, Acquisitions, Inventory, Finance, Selling/Listings, Orders, Fulfilment and Returns.

Category/property management is independent of Buying. Subscribers can create categories for Buying, Selling or both and define category-specific properties/options. Inventory supports direct product creation, category assignment, dynamic property values and photographs. Selling carries inventory photographs into new listings.

These remain BLUE until authenticated browser journeys are persistently tested.

## 7. Buying → Valuation → Offer
049–051 harden dynamic options and Buying workflow. 052–055 harden valuation/offer RLS, same-item valuation binding and state entry. Published offers require an approved valuation for the same tenant and buying item.

## 8. Acquisition
056–057 harden acquisition access and status entry. Inventory creation from an acquisition item is an explicit operation and is not inferred from acquisition status.

## 9. Categories, product properties and inventory media
`categories`, `category_fields` and `category_field_options` are the database-authoritative model. `category-management.html` / `.js` exposes category creation plus property and option creation. `inventory_assets.dynamic_values` stores category-specific product values.

Media foundation:
- private Storage bucket: `tradeflow-media`;
- `media_assets` retention metadata;
- `inventory_asset_media` tenant-scoped inventory links;
- `listing_media` tenant-scoped listing links;
- inventory/listing sold-status triggers setting a **90-day post-sale retention expiry**.

Private images use authenticated Storage and signed URLs. Physical object deletion must use the Storage API. Automatic cleanup scheduling is not configured.

## 10. Subscriber category tenant-context and REST repairs — 17 September 2026
The category database/RLS path was verified independently: Test Business A contains active Buying/Selling `Drones`, and the authenticated owner query returns it. Front-end repairs addressed missing tenant context, unnecessary GET `Content-Type`, missing request timeout and late runtime diagnostics.

A shared `subscriber-tenant-context.js` preloader establishes test-lab tenant context before subscriber controllers. GET/HEAD requests are normalised so they do not carry unnecessary JSON `Content-Type`.

## 11. Dedicated subscriber authentication — 17 September 2026
The screenshot showing `Sign in through the TradeFlow test environment before opening Categories.` identified the deeper issue: the subscriber workspace was trying to use the **customer test-lab session/storage keys**. Platform Owner authentication is deliberately separate too, so opening Platform Administration does not authenticate a subscriber workspace.

A dedicated `subscriber-auth.js` now provides test-environment subscriber authentication. It uses separate storage keys (`tradeflow_subscriber_publishable_key` and `tradeflow_subscriber_session`), signs in by email/password, verifies an active membership in the selected Test Business A/B tenant, and sets the subscriber tenant context. Passwords are not stored.

`subscriber-auth-bridge.js` is a compatibility layer for the existing Category, Inventory and Selling controllers. On those subscriber pages only, reads of the legacy test-lab key names resolve to the dedicated subscriber session. This prevents the Customer Test Lab session from being overwritten. After a new subscriber login, the bridge reloads the page so legacy controllers start with the authenticated subscriber context.

`subscriber-auth-controls.js` binds the existing page sign-out control to the dedicated subscriber session.

Current pages wired to dedicated subscriber authentication:
- `categories.html`
- `inventory-dashboard.html`
- `selling-dashboard.html`

This is test-environment infrastructure. It is not the final production onboarding/authentication model.

## 12. Inventory
058 protects inventory status entry. The repaired Inventory runtime supports product creation, category-specific dynamic values, multiple photographs and workflow-controlled lifecycle changes.

Lifecycle: `received → inspection → testing → repair → ready_for_sale → listed → reserved → sold`, with supported return/write-off/archive branches.

## 13. Finance and payment
059 applies permission-bound access to payment/ledger tables. 060 extends `transition_workflow_entity()` to payment and ledger entities and adds status-entry guards. No automatic payment or ledger creation is inferred from acquisition status.

`record_retail_order_payment()` is the internal subscriber payment path. `customer_create_order_payment()` provides the customer-side idempotent pending-payment boundary.

External Stripe architecture is server-side: `create-stripe-checkout-session` requires a customer JWT; `stripe-payment-webhook` verifies `stripe-signature` and calls protected `process_external_payment_event()`. `payment_provider_events` provides provider/event idempotency. Stripe test configuration is complete, but persistent browser payment verification remains open.

## 14. Selling / Listings
061 hardens listings and related access. Selling creates listings from ready-for-sale inventory and uses workflow authority. New listings inherit inventory media.

## 15. Retail Orders
062 hardens retail order access/status entry. Subscriber Orders creates orders from published listings. Customer checkout creates a pending-payment order, reserves the listing and uses the Stripe boundary for payment.

## 16. Fulfilment
Fulfilment has subscription-aware access and controlled lifecycle progression: `awaiting → label → dispatched → delivered`, with returned branches. No carrier API or automatic fulfilment creation is assumed.

## 17. Returns
Legacy broad returns policies were removed and direct status edits are blocked. `customer_request_return()` validates customer ownership and eligible order states; customer visibility uses secure `customer_get_returns()`.

## 18. Customer dashboard browser repair — VERIFIED LIVE
Customer sign-in/controller timing and navigation interception faults were repaired. The controller `esc()` parse fault was corrected and cache-busted to `v11`. Customer Buying category loading was isolated from optional modules because Test Business A lacks `module.orders`; `customer-dashboard-nav.js` independently loads `customer_get_buying_categories()` after portal reveal. No subscription capability was changed.

## 19. Subscriber JavaScript loading repair — 17 September 2026
Categories, Inventory and Selling shared a malformed `esc()` quote mapping, causing JavaScript parse failure before Supabase requests. Category was repaired in place; clean repaired Inventory and Selling runtimes were created. Inventory signed-URL requests also explicitly send JSON content type.

## 20. Diagnostic and verification standard
Trace every domain as: **User action → page → front-end controller → Supabase call → RPC/query → table/view → trigger/function/RLS/grants → status transition → external integration → visible result → verification state.**

Verification states: **Proposed → Implemented → Tested → Verified Live**. Commit success is not live verification. Transactional rollback testing proves database behaviour, not a persistent browser journey.

## 21. Manual testing and change control
One browser test at a time: exact URL → exact account → exact action → expected result → screenshot/result → PASS/FAIL → next test.

After each material change record what/why, affected files/backend objects, decision, fault/lesson, test, live verification, stopping point and next action. Update this handbook, the Master Roadmap, the AI Operating Manual and structured project memory/checkpoint data where available.

## 22. Current stopping point — 17 September 2026
The category database/RLS path is verified. The browser failure was traced to subscriber pages using customer test-lab session storage instead of a subscriber session. Dedicated subscriber authentication plus a compatibility bridge is now deployed to Categories, Inventory and Selling. **Live browser verification of the new sign-in flow is open.**

**Next action:** hard refresh/open Categories. A Subscriber sign-in dialog should appear if no dedicated subscriber session exists. Sign in using an active Test Business A Owner/Admin/Staff account, select Test Business A, and verify `Drones` appears. Then use the same session to verify Inventory and Selling category selectors. Do not alter subscriptions, category data or RLS to work around this.


## Test Business C — Buy & Sell end-to-end test tenant — 18 September 2026

- Created dedicated test tenant Test Business C (50641519-2aa5-4093-95e5-7e92bea733a6) on the live TradeFlow test environment.
- Assigned the existing Test Business A Admin test identity as an Admin member; no Owner account is required for routine workflow testing.
- Assigned the buy_sell plan in trialing state so Inventory/Selling capability checks can be exercised without weakening RLS or changing Test Business A's Buying-only subscription.
- Seeded a Drones category with model_number (text) and condition (select) plus New/Excellent/Good/Fair/Poor options for end-to-end product testing.
- Added Test Business C to the subscriber authentication and tenant-context allowlists and cache-busted Categories, Inventory and Selling runtimes.
- Test Business A remains the Buying subscription test tenant; Test Business B remains the Selling subscription test tenant. This separation preserves subscription-boundary tests.
